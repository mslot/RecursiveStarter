This is a small startup project of mine because I want to learn Python.

# When to use
Have you ever cloned a repository from Github, and you just wanted to open it in Visual Studio, but you don't know where to look? It might even be that you want know where the sln file is located, but you dont want to make the massive `cd` down to the directory, and then do a `start NameOfMySolution.sln` (yes you can do that btw - Windows will pick the correct version of Visual Studio). By using this script you just do a `py RecursiveStarter.py` in the root, and it will find the first sln file and call start. I have yet to discover how to make aliases etc in Powershell, so I can just type `r`, but that I am currently investigating how to do.

# How to use
I am in the process of writing a simple one-liner install script that setup everything needed.
